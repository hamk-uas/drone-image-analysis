Some observations
1) Some labels are overlapping, so the output may be mixing things up as a result.
2) Same labels may collect quite different features of the facade, so in those algorithm is also mixing things up. 
3) The roof is not labelled.
4) In general, labelling is pretty inaccurate, as labels sometimes take more place on the image than the actual ground truth object.
5) Mirroring and jittering of the ground gruth images seems to be coped with well.
